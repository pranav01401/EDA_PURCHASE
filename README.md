### A Retail company 'ABC private limited' wants to understand customer purchase behaviour (specially purchase amount)against various categories in the products.They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high value product from last month. The dataset also contains customer demographics(age,gender,marital_status,city_type,stay_in_current_city) product details (product_id and product category) and total purchase amount from last month.

    Steps:-  1. Merge the two data files df_test and df_train
             2. Removing the categorical features such as Gender, Age, Stay_in_current_city ,
             3. Removing the null values.
             4. Plotting the money spent on various product categories across all ages and sex.

### Now they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customers against the selected products which will help them to create personalized offers for customer against different products.
